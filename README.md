# bookstore
A platform for easy access of e-books.

The idea behind bookstore is the easy availability of books for school students, undergraduate students and post graduate students.
The books with higher price rates can be made available free of cost or under reasonable prices in e-book formats.
For taking this project further, we need copy rights of the books.
So I've prepared a sample framework for the same.
